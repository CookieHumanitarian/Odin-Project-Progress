# Odin-Project-Progress

First project is to create a simple html page showing recipes. This is created purely using HTML and uses no CSS

My second project is to create a landing page using what is requested from Odin Project. Practised using flexbox and basic CSS

My third project is to create a stimulation of a rock-paper-scissors game against
the computer. Just some practise using basic Javascript
